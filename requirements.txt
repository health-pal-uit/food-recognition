# ===== OPTIONAL: Comment out if not needed =====
# Remove these if you don't use them to reduce slug size:

# webcolors
# tensorboard  # Heavy! ~200MB+ with dependencies
# ensemble-boxes
# pycocotools
# gdown>=4.4.0
# pyngrok

# ===== HEAVY PACKAGES - ONLY INCLUDE IF ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY =====
# These packages are VERY large. Only uncomment if you actually use them:

# timm>=0.5.4  # ~500MB+ with all models
# segmentation-models-pytorch  # ~100MB+
# ultralytics  # ~300MB+ (YOLOv8)

# If you need ultralytics, consider using their API instead:
# https://docs.ultralytics.com/hub/

# If you need timm models, load only specific models from HuggingFace Hub
# If you need segmentation models, use individual model files instead
